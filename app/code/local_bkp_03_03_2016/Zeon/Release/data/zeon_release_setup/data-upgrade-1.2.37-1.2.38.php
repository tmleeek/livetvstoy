<h3 id="instockitems">Item Availability</h3>
<p>A product\'s availability is noted on the product\'s detail page as "In-Stock" or "Out of Stock." If the item is out
of stock, there will be a "Notify Me" option, which will allow you to enter your e-mail address to be notified as soon
as the item is back in stock. Most items on our site are in stock and ready to ship.</p>
<h3 id="customprinteditems">In-Stock Items</h3>
<p>Most orders for In-Stock items begin the order process as soon as your online purchase is completed. Your In-Stock
item will be shipped once the item is located in stock, your payment is approved, and the receiving address is verified.
 You will not be charged for any item until it is shipped to you.</p> <p>For example, if you order an In-Stock item on
 Monday that leaves the warehouse in 1-2 full business days, it will leave the warehouse by end-of-day Wednesday. During
  checkout, you will get to select a shipping method and see the total time it takes for the item to leave the warehouse
   and ship to its destination. Please note that business days are Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays within the
   United States.</p><p>Please note expected shipment times appearing on the product\'s detail page specify when an item
is expected to leave our warehouse, not when the item will arrive at its final shipping destination.</p>
<p>After your order leaves our warehouse, delivery times vary according to the shipping method you select during
checkout and the location of your shipping address.</p>
<h3>Custom Printed Items</h3>
<p>Please allow an additional 2-4 business days for all custom printed items (with or without a name) to be created
prior to shipping. All custom printed items ship by US Mail. International and expedited shipping is not available.</p>
<h3 id="shoppingmethods">Shipping Methods and Costs</h3>
<p>Depending on the item(s) you purchase on Personalized Planet and the location to which the items will be delivered,
different shipping methods will be available. Each shipping method has its own restrictions and charges that will be
applied to your order.</p><p>At checkout, you will be prompted to choose a shipping method for your item(s). (Please
note, some items may offer only one shipping method.) Shipping costs are dependent on the items in your order and the
shipping method you select. Your total shipping charges will automatically compute during checkout prior to the
completion of your order.</p><p>Generally, you will have the option of upgrading your shipping method for faster
delivery (such as Second Day or Overnight service). If you choose to upgrade your shipping method, your order must be
received and clear credit authorization by 12:00 p.m. (noon) EST or your order may not be processed until the following
business day. Business days are Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays within the United States.</p>
<h4>Domestic Shipping</h4>
<p>We pride ourselves on being one of the fastest shippers on the Internet. If you place your order Monday - Friday
before 3 pm EST, the order will usually ship the same day. Orders placed after the 3 pm EST cutoff will usually ship the
 next business day. Orders placed between Friday 3 pm EST and Monday 3 pm EST will usually ship that Monday.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Economy Ground: </span>Delivered by your local Post Office, this is our most economical shipping method.
Delivery confirmation is provided and this method takes approximately 4-7 business days for delivery. P.O. Boxes are
accepted with this shipping method.</li>
<li><span>Standard Ground: </span>Designed for residential deliveries, orders using this method arrive within
approximately 3-5 business days. This method CANNOT ship to P.O. Boxes.</li>
<li><span>FedEx 2nd Day Air: </span>Guaranteed 2 business day (Monday - Friday, excluding holidays) delivery to most
locations in the U.S. mainland after the package leaves our warehouse. Generally all 2nd Day Air orders ship from our
warehouse on the same day if order is placed by 3:00 pm EST. This method CANNOT ship to P.O. Boxes.</li>
<li><span>FedEx Next Day Air: </span>Guaranteed next business day delivery to most locations in the U.S. mainland after
the package leaves our warehouse. Generally all Next Day Air orders ship from our warehouse on the same day if ordered
by 3:00 pm EST. Shipping to your business address could result in more timely delivery over shipping to your residential
 address. This method CANNOT ship to P.O. Boxes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Third Party Ship</h4>
<p>Personalized Planet offers a large selection of items that may be sent by various shipping carriers depending on
where the item is shipping from. Orders that contain items shipping from various locations will arrive in separate
packages. Please allow 3 to 4 extra days for shipping these items. Expedited or express shipping may not be available on
 orders containing these items during checkout.</p>
<h4>Shipping to Alaska and Hawaii</h4>
<p>We ship all orders to Alaska and Hawaii via USPS Priority Mail. While most orders arrive in a timely manner,
occasionally shipments may take 2-5 weeks. If you haven\'t received your order in 14 business days, please e-mail
<a href="mailto:customerservice@personalizedplanet.com">customerservice@personalizedplanet.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="shoppingrules">Shipping Rules and Restrictions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Orders are shipped on business days only. Business days are Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays within the
United States.</li>
<li>Personalized Planet makes every effort to ship In-Stock items within 24 hours of order placement.</li>
<li>All expedited orders require a street address.</li>

shipping promotions and are not available to be shipped internationally or using expedited shipping methods.</p>
<h3 id="trackingandorder">Tracking Your Order</h3>
<p>At our warehouse, tracking numbers are assigned to packages and are generally available within 24 hours. However, it
may take up to 48 hours or longer before the package is checked into the carrier\'s tracking system. Therefore, even
though your package has already shipped from our warehouse and is on its way to you, the carrier may not be able to
provide any information about your package for up to 48 hours or more. Please allow an additional 2-4 business days for
custom printed items to be created prior to shipping.</p>
<p>When you click on "Track Order," you will be prompted to login with your e-mail address and order number. An order
summary page will provide you with detailed information about your current order or past orders. After your order is
shipped, your tracking number, if available, will be displayed. Depending on the shipping company, you can click on the
tracking number to view the delivery status of your order. A shipping company may not have the ability to track a number
 for up to 24 business hours.</p>
<p>Orders placed on Personalized Planet may be delivered by one of several different carriers and shipping methods.
Therefore, tracking availability may vary depending on the type of item you purchased, the shipping method you selected
during Checkout, and the carrier that is delivering your item(s).</p>

<h3 id="privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We are committed to making your online transaction safe, secure, and confidential to the highest standards available.
 Following are some relevant facts about how we treat your information.</p>
<p>We do not share or sell data. We collect billing and shipping information in order to process your order and deliver
it to its destination. This information is used only by Personalized Planet and the couriers we use for the purposes of
fulfilling your order. Personal information collected through this site is used only for our internal purposes. We will
not sell your personal information, or authorize third parties to use such information for any commercial purpose,
without your prior consent.</p>
<h4>Personal Information</h4>
<p>We do not automatically collect personal information such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address.
Such information will be collected only if you provide it to us voluntarily in order to order products, enter a contest
or promotion, or sign up to receive our e-Update newsletter. We don\'t require that any personal information be provided
in order to view our website.</p>
<p><strong>Information collected by Personalized Planet is used to: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>allow you to order products, register for e-Update and participate in special promotions;</li>
<li>improve the site by observing products that are most popular; and</li>
<li>personalize the delivery of information and recommend products to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your personal information may also be used to create statistics about Personalized Planet that we use to measure our
performance. These statistics do not contain any information that could identify you personally. Personalized Planet
does not sell your personal information to any organization for any purpose.</p>
<p><strong>We do send email.</strong> We will send you email at regular intervals to ensure that you are always kept up
to date on the status of your order. From time to time we send additional eflyers out to inform our customers of
specials or promotions that they might be interested in. You can choose not to receive the eflyers by selecting this
option in your Tys Toy Box account.</p>
<p><strong>We offer Optional Registration.</strong> We recommend that you register as a customer in order to take
advantage of the many benefits of maintaining an account. Unlike many other sites, registration is not necessary for
placing orders. We offer a "buy now" option, which only requires the basic information required to process your order.
Please note that this will limit access to your order history and an address book.</p>
<p><strong>Credit Card info protected by 128bit SSL Encryption.</strong> The security of your personal information is
paramount. All Credit Card Transactions are completed using a 128 Bit SSL Encrypted Secure Transaction. As we transmit
the information to the Bank\'s Secure SSL Server, they require a 128-bit transaction and will not process a transaction
without one. Even though 40 or 56 Bit transactions are very secure, our Bank\'s insistence on 128 Bit SSL means that
there is never any chance of your information every being intercepted or decoded.</p>
<p><strong>Password Protected Accounts.</strong> When you decide to register an account in order to take advantage of
the address book, quick pay and order restoration features, your account information is secured by password protection
assigned and maintained by you. If you forget your password, this information is only released to your specific e-mail
address recorded in your account profile. It is not given out in any other situation without identity verification
provided by you. The account information contains the billing and shipping addresses, phone numbers and e-mail address
provided and maintained by you as well as your order history. Credit card information is not included in this file.</p>

<p>At our warehouse, tracking numbers are assigned to packages and are generally available within 24 hours. However, it

though your package has already shipped from our warehouse and is on its way to you, the carrier may not be able to
provide any information about your package for up to 48 hours or more. Please allow an additional 2-4 business days for
custom printed items to be created prior to shipping.</p>
<p>When you click on &ldquo;Track Order&rdquo;, you will be prompted to log in with your e-mail address and order
number. An order summary page will provide you with detailed information about your current order or past orders. After
your order is shipped, your tracking number, if available, will be displayed. Depending on the shipping company, you can
 click on the tracking number to view the delivery status of your order. A shipping company may not have the ability to
  track a number for up to 24 business hours.</p>
<p>Orders placed on PersonalizePlanet.com may be delivered by one of several different carriers and shipping methods.
