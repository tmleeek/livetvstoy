            <div class="std"><h1>BIRTHSTONES</h1>

<p>The concept of linking birth dates with particular gems, and attributing to these stones the power to affect the wearer, is the oldest jewelry tradition. In addition to representing a significant month, the symbolism attached to each birthstone gives each gem a beauty and importance that makes it a truly personal gift.<br /> <br /> Be creative when selecting birthstone jewelry. Choose a ruby ring for that fiery and passionate person in your life or choose an amethyst jewelry set to celebrate a sixth anniversary. Whatever your situation, there\'s a birthstone to express your feelings. Read through the lore below to find out what each stone signifies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>January: Garnet</strong></p>
<p>In addition to symbolizing second anniversaries, the radiant garnet has been worn throughout history by travelers seeking protection. Legend has it that Noah used a large garnet to light his ark. While most people are familiar with the dark red-colored garnet, this gemstone comes in a variety of shades. Believed to represent faith, constancy, and truth, the garnet is favored for its beauty and symbolism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>February: Amethyst</strong></p>
<p>Found in varying shades of purple, the amethyst represents royalty, piety, and sobriety. This gemstone is given as a sixth anniversary gift in addition to symbolizing sincerity and stability. Wear amethyst to heighten your natural intuition and help get in touch with your inner self.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>March: Aquamarine</strong></p>
<p>Literally meaning "sea water," this pastel blue-colored gemstone is known to reduce fear and stimulate self expression. A symbol of happiness and everlasting youth, the aquamarine is also suggested as a nineteenth anniversary gift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>April: Diamond</strong></p>
<p>In addition to being a girl\'s best friend and a symbol of commitment, the diamond is well known for its beauty and durability. Traditionally given as a tenth anniversary gift, diamonds provide the perfect touch to any ensemble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>May: Emerald</strong></p>
<p>Believed to aid one\'s memory and intelligence, and promote honesty, the emerald was dedicated to Venus, the goddess of love. Lovers believed that the bright green color would expose the faithfulness of their significant other. Now, it is the same awe-inspiring green color which makes the emerald one of the most popular choices for jewelry. This gemstone is suggested for twentieth and thirty-fifth anniversaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>June: Alexandrite </strong></p>
<p>Alexandrite is long believed to be associated with self-control. Many believe that alexandrite stones can promote concentration and the ability to learn. The stones are said to bring peace of mind. &nbsp;The beautiful color of this gemstone is admired and is traditionally given for</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>July: Ruby</strong></p>
<p>Highly prized by emperors and kings, the ruby is believed to preserve the wearer\'s body and mental health by removing evil thoughts, controlling amorous desires, and reconciling disputes. The gemstone\'s fiery red color represents stimulation, life, heat, and power. Desired by both men and women alike, this most precious gem is perfect for any occasion, but is especially suggested for fifteenth and fortieth anniversaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>August: Peridot</strong></p>
<p>Long associated with spring and renewal, the peridot is also known as the "evening gemstone" because its color intensifies in the evening light. This gemstone is believed to bring its wearer success, peace, and good luck. The peridot is thought to provide protection, health, and sleep; it is also used to attract love and calm anger in addition to soothing nerves and dispelling negative emotion. It is traditionally given for the sixteenth anniversary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>September: Sapphire</strong></p>
<p>The deep blue of the sapphire carries its own distinct beauty. Given for the fifth and twenty-third anniversaries, the sapphire provides accents to all jewelry designs. This gemstone provides its wearer with spiritual enlightenment and inner peace. Known as the gem of destiny, it can help make your dreams come true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>October: Pink Tourmaline</strong></p>
<p>Opals are famous for their "play of colors". Beliefs associated with the wearing of opal have varied: the early Greeks claimed that opals gave their owners the powers of prophecy, Romans adored it as a token of hope and purity, Arabs believed it fell from heaven. During the Medieval period, a change in the color of an opal was believed to indicate if the wearer was in good health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>November: Citrine</strong></p>
<p>The citrine represents the thirteenth anniversary and is believed to symbolize lightheartedness and joy. In ancient times, people carried citrine as a protection against snake venom and evil thoughts. People born in November are especially able to experience the calmness and hope that the citrine brings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>December: Blue Topaz</strong></p>
<p>Blue Topaz is the anniversary gemstone for the 4th year of marriage. Legend says that it dispels all enchantment and helps to improve eyesight. The ancient Greeks believed that it had the power to increase strength and make its wearer invisible in times of emergency. Blue Topaz is favored for its beautiful luster and color.</p>
