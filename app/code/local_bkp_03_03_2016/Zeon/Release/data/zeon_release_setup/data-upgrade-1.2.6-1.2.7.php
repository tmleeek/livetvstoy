                                <p>PayPal is an alternate method for purchasing
                                your order on TysToyBox.com. It enables any
                                individual or business with an email address to
                                securely send payments online. With a PayPal
                                account, you can choose to pay with your credit
                                card, debit card, bank account, or PayPal
                                account balance for any purchase you make. Your
                                credit card and bank numbers are never seen by
                                the seller or merchant. Plus, you\'re 100%
        protected against unauthorized payments sent from your account.</p>

                </p>
                <p><span>We do send email.</span> We will send you email at
                regular intervals to ensure that you are always kept up to date
                on the status of your order. From time to time we send

                not to receive the eflyers by selecting this option in your Tys

                <p><span>We offer Optional Registration.</span> We recommend
                that you register as a customer in order to take advantage of
                the many benefits of maintaining an account. Unlike many other
                sites, registration is not necessary for placing orders. We
                offer a "buy now" option, which only requires the basic
                information required to process your order. Please note that
                this will limit access to your order history and an address
                book.</p>
                <p><span>Credit Card info protected by 128bit SSL Encryption.
                </span> The security of your personal information is paramount.
                All Credit Card Transactions are completed using a 128 Bit SSL
                Encrypted Secure Transaction. As we transmit the information to
                the Bank\'s Secure SSL Server, they require a 128-bit
                transaction and will not process a transaction without one. Even
                though 40 or 56 Bit transactions are very secure, our Bank\'s
                insistence on 128 Bit SSL means that there is never any chance
                of your information every being intercepted or decoded.</p>
                <p><span>Password Protected Accounts.</span> When you decide to
                register an account in order to take advantage of the address
                book, quick pay and order restoration features, your account
                information is secured by password protection assigned and
                maintained by you. If you forget your password, this information
                is only released to your specific email address recorded in your
                account profile. It is not given out in any other situation
                without identity verification provided by you. The account
                information contains the billing and shipping addresses, phone
                numbers and email address provided and maintained by you as well
                as your order history. Credit card information is not included

                 <h3 id="instockitems">In-Stock Items</h3>
                <p>Most orders for In-Stock items begin the order process as
                soon as your online purchase is completed. Your In-Stock item
                will be shipped once the item is located in stock, your payment
                is approved, and the receiving address is verified. You will not
                be charged for any item until it is shipped to you.</p>
                <p>For example, if you order an In-Stock item on Monday that
                leaves the warehouse in 1-2 full business days, it will leave
                the warehouse by end-of-day Wednesday. During checkout, you will
                get to select a shipping method and see the total time it takes
                for the item to leave the warehouse and ship to its destination.
                Please note that business days are Monday-Friday, excluding
                federal holidays within the United States.</p>
                <p>Please note expected shipment times appearing on the
                product&rsquo;s detail page specify when an item is expected to
                leave our warehouse not when the item will arrive at its final
                shipping destination. After your order leaves our warehouse,
                delivery times vary according to the shipping method you select
                during checkout and the location of your shipping address.</p>
                <h3 id="customprinteditems">Custom Printed Items</h3>
                <p>Please allow an additional 2-4 business days for all custom
                printed items (with or without a name) to be created prior to
                shipping.  All custom printed items ship by US Mail.
                International and expedited shipping is not available.</p>
                <h3 id="shoppingmethods">Shipping Methods and Costs</h3>
                <p>Depending on the item(s) you purchase on TysToyBox.com and
                the location to which the items will be delivered, different
                shipping methods will be available. Each shipping method has its
                own restrictions and charges that will be applied to your order.
                </p>
                <p>At checkout, you will be prompted to choose a shipping method
                for your item(s). (Please note, some items may offer only one
                shipping method.) Shipping costs are dependent on the items in
                your order and the shipping method you select. Your total
                shipping charges will automatically compute during checkout
                prior to the completion of your order.</p>
                <p>Generally, you will have the option of upgrading your
                shipping method for faster delivery (such as Second Day, or
                Overnight service). If you choose to upgrade your shipping
                method, your order must be received and clear credit
                authorization by 12:00 p.m. (noon) EST or your order may not be
                processed until the following business day. Business days are
                Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays within the United
                States.</p>

                the Internet. If you place your order Monday - Friday before

                placed after the 3 pm EST cutoff will usually ship the next
                business day. Orders placed between Friday 3 pm EST and Monday
                3 pm EST will usually ship that Monday.</p>
